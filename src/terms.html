						company. They set out the rights and obligations of all users regarding the use of the service.
					</p>
					<p>Your access to and use of the service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with
						these terms and conditions. They apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the
						service.</p>

					<p>You represent that you are over the age of 18. The company does not permit those under 18 to use

					<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
					<p>Our service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or
						controlled by the company.</p>
					<p>The company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy
						policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. You acknowledge and agree that
						the company shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss
						caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such
						content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or services.</p>
					<p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party
						websites or services that you visit.</p>
					<h2>Termination</h2>
					<p>We may terminate or suspend your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any
						reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these terms and conditions.</p>
					<p>Upon termination, your right to use the service will cease immediately.</p>
					<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
					<p>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of the company and any of
						its suppliers under any provision of these terms and your exclusive remedy for all of the
						foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you through the service or 100 USD if
						you haven't purchased anything through the service.</p>
					<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the company or its suppliers
						be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including,
						but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business
						interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the
						use of or inability to use the service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used
						with the service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of these terms), even if the
						company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the
						remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
					<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for
						incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not
						apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted
						by law.</p>
					<h2>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>
					<p>The service is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without
						warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the company, on its
						own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service
						providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or
						otherwise, with respect to the service, including all implied warranties of merchantability,
						fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out
						of the course of dealing, course of performance, usage, or trade practice. Without limitation to
						the foregoing, the company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of
						any kind that the service will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
						compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems, or services, operate without
						interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards, or be error-free, or that any
						errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
					<p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the company nor any of its providers makes any
						representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or
						availability of the service, or the information, content, and materials or products included
						thereon; (ii) that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy,
						reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the service; or (iv)
						that the service, its servers, the content, or emails sent from or on behalf of the company are
						free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs, or other harmful components.
					</p>
					<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on
						applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and
						limitations may not apply to you. But in such a case, the exclusions and limitations set forth
						in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
					<h2>Governing Law</h2>
					<p>The laws of the country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern these terms and your
						use of the service. Your use of the application may also be subject to other local, state,
						national, or international laws.</p>
					<h2>Disputes Resolution</h2>
					<p>If you have any concern or dispute about the service, you agree to first try to resolve the
						dispute informally by contacting the company.</p>
					<h2>Severability and Waiver</h2>
					<h3>Severability</h3>
					<p>If any provision of these terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be
						changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
						possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and
						effect.</p>
					<h3>Waiver</h3>
					<p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an
						obligation under these terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or
						require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a
						waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
					<h2>Translation Interpretation</h2>
					<p>These terms and conditions may have been translated if we have made them available to you on our
						service. You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.</p>
					<h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
					<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these terms at any time. If a
						revision is material, we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior
						to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our
						sole discretion.</p>
					<p>By continuing to access or use our service after those revisions become effective, you agree to
						be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please
						stop using the website and the service.</p>
